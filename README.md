# Jonathan Slark – Game programmer

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a game programmer with a focus on performance-oriented C programming and modern graphics APIs. My work spans from retro-inspired games to graphics programming and game modding.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🕹️ Games

## 🎯 What I'm Working On
I'm currently developing more games and transitioning towards 3D assets in a top-down view while maintaining a 2D-style gameplay experience. My future work will focus on high-quality rendering and dynamic lighting.
