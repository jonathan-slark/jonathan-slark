# 👋 Jonathan Slark – Games Programmer

Hi, I’m Jonathan. I’m a solo games programmer focused on creating desktop games with clean architecture, responsive gameplay, and minimal dependencies. Right now I’m exploring low-level rendering (OpenGL, Vulkan) and building foundational systems from scratch to better understand how modern games work under the hood.

My long-term goal is to release a commercial-quality game. Whether I continue building everything from scratch or switch to a game engine depends on the needs of each project — right now, it’s all about learning, finishing, and improving.
